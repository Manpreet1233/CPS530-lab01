            1. Here is the html code for lab01: <a href="./code.txt">lab1.html</a><br>
            2. Inorder to password protect my page I wrote a small script where I have the correct password saved in a variable, while an another variable is used to prompt the user to enter the password, if both match then show the user the content, if not redirect them some place else, in this case the cps530 website.<br>
            3. I have been coding in html and css for a couple of years now so i have used all the html tags. <br>
            4. When I look at my webpage in chrome verses when I look at it in safari they look the same. However, the webpage does look different when I go to view it on different phones and ipad. This is because depending on the size of the electronic device, the screen must just accordingly thus, shifting the whole page around. <br>
            5. I did not work on this lab all at once. I worked on it in small portions so this lab took me approximately 3 days to complete.
